# rfordatascience
Working through some things in "R for Data Science" by HW and GG

This is an example project focused on working through part of
"R for Data Science".

Created a new project in a local folder called /rfordatascience.

* the /rfordatascience did **not** exist; RStudio created it when creating the project,
* Checked box for creating a git repository,
* created this README.md file to document meta steps.
