Need to load **stringr** explicitly since not part of core **tidyverse**.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
```

# Introduction

Both single and double quotes are fine. You can always escape a quote literal.

Remember that printed representation of a string is not the same as the
string itself.

```{r}
x <- c("\"", "\\")
x
```

To see the strings themselves, use `writeLines()`. You get one string per line.

```{r}
writeLines(x)
```
